# skillbird-go-rest-api
To address the growing scalability Issues of the skillbird framework, this REST-Api is a work in progress to act as a middleware between all three existing parts: The sourcemod plugin, the rating system itself and the leaderboard. Currently they all use the same database directly and it's starting to show, in terms of performance and read/write locking inefficiencies.

Please report only bugs directly related to the functionality of the REST-Api itself here. If you have problems with any other parts of the framework please report them in the [main project](https://github.com/FAUSheppy/skillbird).
